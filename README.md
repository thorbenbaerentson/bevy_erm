This project serves as helper for building an ERM-System for bevy. The Term is borrowed from well known ORM-System like the 'Entity Framework' and stands for Entity Relational Mapping. It uses the reflection system bevy implements to automatically build database schemas from struct defintions and allows to store and retrieve entities (actually its components) in a database.
